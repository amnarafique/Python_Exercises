Mailing Address

Create a program that displays your name and complete mailing address. The address
should be printed in the format that is normally used in the area where you live. Your
program does not need to read any input from the user.


name = "Amna Rafique"
mailing_adress = "Street-7,Toronto, "
print(name, "lives in",  mailing_adress)
