Widgets and Gizmos

An online retailer sells two products: widgets and gizmos. Each widget weighs 75
grams. Each gizmo weighs 112 grams. Write a program that reads the number of
widgets and the number of gizmos from the user. Then your program should compute
and display the total weight of the parts.


widgets = int(input("how many no. of wigets you want ?"))
gizmos = int(input("how many no. of gizmos you want ?"))
weight_of_widgets = widgets * 75
print("weight of widgets is", weight_of_widgets, "grams")
weight_of_gizmos = gizmos * 112
print("weight of gizmos is", weight_of_gizmos, "grams")
total_weight = weight_of_gizmos + weight_of_widgets
print("your total weight is ", total_weight, "grams")
