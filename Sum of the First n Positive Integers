Sum of the First n Positive Integers

Write a program that reads a positive integer, n, from the user and then displays the
sum of all of the integers from 1 to n. The sum of the first n positive integers can be
computed using the formula:
sum = (n)(n + 1)/2


n = int(input("enetr any positive number"))
sum = (n)*(n+1)/2
print("the sum of first positive integer is", sum)
