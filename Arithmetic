Arithmetic

Create a program that reads two integers, a and b, from the user. Your program should
compute and display:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
The sum of a and b
The difference when b is subtracted from a
The product of a and b
The quotient when a is divided by b
The remainder when a is divided by b
The result of log 10 a
The result of a b
Hint: You will probably find the log10 function in the math module helpful
for computing the second last item in the list.



import math
num_1 = int(input('enter any  number'))
num_2 = int(input("enter one more number"))
print(num_1 + num_2)
print(num_1 - num_2)
print(num_1 * num_2)
print(num_1 / num_2)
print(num_1 % num_2)
print(num_1 ** num_2)
print(math.log10(num_1))
